  </mat-card-header>
  <mat-card-content>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Our project is a web-based platform that enables users to easily create and modify 3D models using OpenSCAD, a parametric CAD software. The platform is designed for accessibility, targeting both beginners looking to learn 3D modeling and experienced users needing a simple interface for custom designs. Once a model is complete, users can seamlessly send it to a connected 3D printing service (like Slant3D) for affordable, high-quality prints.</p>
    
    <h3>Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Interactive 3D Modeling Interface: Integrates OpenSCAD, allowing users to edit parameters and see real-time 3D previews.</li>
      <li>Pre-built Templates for Easy Customization: Users can start with ready-made templates and modify dimensions, shapes, and other parameters.</li>
      <li>Export and Print Options: Users can export STL files or directly connect to a 3D printing service for an on-demand print option.</li>
      <li>Tutorials and Educational Content: Step-by-step tutorials help users learn CAD principles and familiarize themselves with OpenSCAD.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Title:</h4>
    <p>Introducing the Ultimate 3D Modeling Platform for Beginners and Professionals Alike</p>
    
    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p>Creating custom 3D models and bringing them to life can be intimidating for beginners, with many tools requiring extensive knowledge and expensive software. Our platform simplifies 3D modeling, offering a web-based, intuitive interface that integrates OpenSCAD for easy parameter-based design. Plus, with a built-in connection to a 3D printing service, users can take their designs from screen to reality without ever leaving the website.</p>
    
    <h4>Problem Statement:</h4>
    <p>Learning 3D modeling traditionally requires a lot of time and resources. Existing tools can be too complex for newcomers and often don’t have affordable, integrated printing solutions. We wanted to create a platform that’s both educational and practical, letting users learn the basics while also creating real, functional 3D models.</p>
    
    <h4>Solution and Key Features:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Accessible 3D Modeling: The platform uses OpenSCAD, an open-source CAD software that’s well-suited for parametric design, meaning users can control their model dimensions and shapes through easy-to-understand parameters.</li>
      <li>Pre-built Templates: To simplify the process further, users can start with templates and modify only the essential dimensions and shapes, getting them comfortable with CAD principles while producing a usable 3D model.</li>
      <li>Seamless 3D Printing: Through a printing service API, users can directly send their models to be printed. They get cost-effective access to physical models without having to download files and find external print services.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>How It Works (Implementation):</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Backend (Flask): Handles the OpenSCAD processing by executing scripts that generate STL files based on user-defined parameters.</li>
      <li>Frontend (Angular): Provides an interactive UI, where users can adjust parameters, view live previews, and access tutorial content.</li>
      <li>API for Printing Service: Connects with a 3D printing service (like Slant3D) to submit models for printing, streamlining the process of getting a physical object.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Challenges and Solutions:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>OpenSCAD Integration: Running OpenSCAD in a way that’s compatible with our backend (especially on free hosting platforms) presented challenges, which we solved by using the AppImage for consistent results.</li>
      <li>User Interface Design: Ensuring an intuitive UI for beginners was key. We used Angular Material and Bootstrap to rapidly prototype a clean, responsive design.</li>
      <li>Connecting to the 3D Printing API: The API integration required adapting to the service’s requirements while ensuring smooth file handling and submission.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Benefits to Users:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn by Doing: Beginners can learn 3D modeling by experimenting with templates, watching tutorials, and seeing immediate results.</li>
      <li>Save Time and Money: Users don’t need to purchase expensive software or hardware. They can design, export, and even print, all from one platform.</li>
      <li>Accessible: The platform lowers the barriers for getting started with 3D modeling, making it easy for anyone to create functional models.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
    <p>Our platform offers a comprehensive solution for both beginners and experienced users to create, modify, and print 3D models with ease. By integrating OpenSCAD and connecting to a 3D printing service, we provide a seamless experience from design to physical object.</p>
